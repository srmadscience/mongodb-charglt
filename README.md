# mongodb-charglt
Mongo implementation of Charglt

* Has the  basic functionality of charglt, but is missing stuff  - see TODO
## TODO
 
* Make extrajson payload mongo centric
* Feed to downstream systems
* Unlock and reset records partially working
* Running totals not working
* Make scale - currently is sync and one thread

## Status

While this is fine to play with, it's not a fair representation of MongoDB at the moment.
